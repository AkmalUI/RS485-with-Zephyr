## RS485 Testing using MAX485 Module in Zephyr Framework.

Using two MCUs, ESP32 and STM32, to send messages to each other.
The ESP32 sends the message: "Hello from ESP32!" to the STM32.
The STM32 sends the message: "Hello from STM32!" to the ESP32.
Messages are exchanged automatically every second.
